VEX Robotics Competition Team 177 were the Twisted Botz of Gloucester, Hanover, and later Richmond, VA.
[VEX Robotics Competition](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition)
is the world's largest robotics competition. Teams from an ever-increasing number of countries 
enter their robots to play two-on-two on a 12' by 12' field.

Matches are two robots on the *blue alliance* against two robots on the *red alliance*. Each competition begins with qualifying rounds and ends with a best-of-three elimination bracket where each alliance is three teams (two teams' robots play any given match). Robots must compete autonomously for the first fifteen seconds of each two-minute match; after this, the team may tele-operate their robot. Tim usually programmed in some autonomous features during the teleoperation period to limit human error.

A new competition game is released each year, so teams must
re-engineer their robots each year.

Tim joined the team in September of 2011 and became a robot captain in January of 2013.
While he was a member, the World Championship grew from
400 to 600 teams, and the percentage of teams from the USA dropped to about 60%.
[Click here](./awards.md) to see a list of awards the team earned while Tim was captain.

The Twisted Botz were [very successful](./awards.md), reaching the
VEX Robotics World Championship (a.k.a. VEX Worlds)
consistently every year. This put them in the top 10% of teams worldwide.
When Virginia grew large enough to have its own State Championship, the Twisted Botz were strong competitors each year.

The Twisted Botz are very recognizeable: we always wore bright green shirts. The Twisted Botz umbrella sometimes included multiple robots; Little Hawk entered as 177 (with no letter) but the remaining three robots entered as 177X.

### Spitfire 1 & 2

Spitfire competed in [VEX Nothing but Net](https://youtu.be/A8daR6qBw3M).
The goal of this game was twofold:

* Get balls in the net (or under the rim for reduced points);
* Lift your partner or be lifted.

The robots' initial size was limited to an 18-inch cube.
Robots were only allowed to expand when in their own back corner, so the only allowable means of scoring balls in the net was to launch them.
Our team attempted to build a lifting mechanism in both versions one and two of Spitfire; neither design worked well, so we chose to specialize in ball-shooting.
Tim later redesigned Spitfire a second time on his own [and the lift worked.](./spitfire3.html)

Below are some videos of Spitfire in action.

### Overdrive

Overdrive competed in [VEX Skyrise](https://youtu.be/PJ-5H3JVtPs).
The goal of this game was fourfold:

* Score your color cubes on posts (and descore opponents' cubes when legal);
* Build your own post, called a Skyrise, from stackable yellow Skyrise sections;
* Score your color cubes on the Skyrise.

The robots' initial size was limited to an 18-inch cube.
Robots were allowed to expand without bound once the match began.

#### Problems and Solutions

##### Expanding Structure

A winning robot needed to become about six feet (2 m) tall to score on a fully-built Skyrise.

To accomplish this task, we initially chose a double four-bar linkage.
We rejected a scissor lift design on the basis of complexity and lack of flexibility.
The upper and lower linkages were separate to allow the robot to reach over obstacles.
This ability rarely proved useful, and two separate linkages increased structural load and decreased stiffness.
Furthermore, it required us to use a control loop to keep the two in sync.
So, in Overdrive 2.0, we geared the two linkages together, eliminating significant complexity.
The upper and lower linkages of Overdrive 2.0 were mirror images in 2-D, so the in-plane motion of the linkage was almost perfectly linear.

##### Out-of-plane motion

The linkages were obviously designed to move in their respective planes.
Since we had not yet studied statics, we didn't understand all the bending and torsion loading that
structure needed to endure.

The biggest issue was that the two sides were separately actuated,
so they could move out of sync and twist the entire structure.
Even if we used a proportional controller to hold the two sides in sync,
resisting side-to-side moment loads took its toll on the motors, so
sometimes the lower linkage motors overheated.

To solve this problem, we had to mechanically link the two
lower linkage motors. Then, the linkage was mostly straight up and down
(with the help of some structural stiffening.)

##### Picking and placing cubes

We chose a "needle intake" which reaches inside the hollow cubes because

* It was simpler and lighter than a mechanism which reached outside the cubes;
* It could hold the cubes regardless of their angle (unlike e.g. hooks).

To simplify driving and reduce the number of actuators, we used
a ratchet mechanism: pushing the needle through a cube latched the cube, and
extending a pneumatic piston released the ratchet. We chose pneumatics because

* Our only allowed pneumatics were solenoid-operated and thus binary (on/off);
* We were limited to ten motors and wanted to use them for applications requiring more than two positions.

We initially attempted to make an omni-directional needle. While it worked, the
size of the ratchet mechanism made picking up cubes difficult. We attempted to build a cone on the bottom to help align the cubes, but
the needle was too narrow and flimsy.

So, for Overdrive 2.0, we redesigned the needle to handle two cube positions:

1. Sides parallel and normal to the robot (straight on);
2. Sides 45° to the robot (crooked).

All sides of the needle were thus 90° or 45° to the front of the robot.
We used a funnel-shaped bumper surface of the robot to align the cubes
under the needle, so driving the robot into a cube prepared it to pick a cube.
If the cube was not perfectly straight or perfectly crooked, angled surfaces of the needle
shoved the cube into one of those positions as the heavy linkage dropped on it.

### Little Hawk

Little Hawk was the Twisted Botz' second of three competing robots in [VEX Sack Attack](https://youtu.be/N-ehrKSYfjk).

The game revolved around *sacks* (5" by 5" beanbags) which could be scored in the low, the high, or the floor goal.
The low goals were wide troughs and the high goals were flat rimmed plates. The floor goals were colored squares in the floor of the field.

The sacks were team-agnostic; they counted for the side whose color goal they were scored in.
The sacks could be both scored (dropped in the goals) and descored (removed from the goals).
Frequently a team descored from an opponent's goal to score in their own.

#### Problems and Solutions

##### Robots and Beanbags??

On a foam floor, the sacks were not easy for a robot to handle since they were nonrigid.
Rather than grippers, the winning teams employed large mechanisms
which engulfed the sacks wherever they could be, since their precise positions and orientations were unknown.
Two winning designs emerged:

* Roller intakes: like a combine harvester, these robots rolled over the beanbags and sucked them into a hopper.
* Scoops: somewhere between a front-end loader and a forklift, these robots pushed thin forks or scoops under the beanbags and stored them in a designated place.

Our robot was a scoop. Although the world champions all used roller intakes, we nearly defeated them
since we could shove our scoop under their "nose" while they tried to defend their goal.

##### Heavy Loads

Each sack weighed 0.5 lb. There were 104 sacks on the field. So, the winning teams carried many sacks at a time.
For a 15-20 lb robot, five pounds of sacks is quite a lot. Our robot routinely carried five pounds (it could carry seven).
We initially reused an old design with two cheap gearmotors connected on the same axle. When the two
motors went out of sync, the gears locked and the lift stopped working. We solved this problem redundantly: we used the best legal motors and we connected them via chains, which provided enough leeway that they could stop at slightly different angles without needing to backdrive.
To avoid backdriving, we hard-coded a small power signal to the motors to counteract the effect of gravity.

#### Other Accomplishments

Tim had never written C code before. Our team used [RobotC](https://www.robotc.net), so Tim learned to program via tutorials and trial-and-error.

A more experienced team captain congratulated Tim, "That's an awesome autonomous."
