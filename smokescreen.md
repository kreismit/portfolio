SmokeScreen will be a network of smart fire helmets allowing firefighters to quickly navigate buildings in thick smoke.

**Project Goal**: Show each firefighter a dynamic floorplan of the building around them, with dots or arrows showing other firefighters' locations, in a heads-up display attached to their helmet. Also send this image to the incident commander's computer, allowing them to better coordinate operations.

Comparison of echoes from a wall turned 30° to the left and a wall turned 30° to the right relative to the sensor. The first peak is the transmitted ping and the second is the returning ping. Note the time offsets of the second peaks: the angle of the wall can be determined using the difference in time-of-flight between the two peaks.

## Previous Classes

SmokeScreen began as a project for PHYS 3360: Electronic Circuits.
This lab-heavy class required students to construct an electronic project of their choice. Tim and his lab partner Phil built *sonar-mapper*, a device which, when spun in a circle, built a 2-D map of a room and saved the result to a file.
It earned an A+, but the teacher gave suggestions to improve it.

In MAE 4351, *sonar-mapper* became SmokeScreen as Tim's team built a case for firefighter's need of navigational help. Market research showed that not only are firefighters interested in such a device, but supervisors are willing to buy it. The estimated market potential was in the billions. The prototype was somewhat functional, producing results which were rather unhelpful in navigating unknown territory.
