For our final project, we were instructed to animate a triple pendulum (three-link chain).
Each link was assumed rigid and each joint was assumed to have no backlash or friction.

Below are the results of three simulations, each solving different differential equations:

Figure 3. Triple pendulum simulation with the Lagrange equations.

To verify the solution, we compared the trajectories from the three different sets of equations.

Figure 4. The three different solutions were identical.


Then, we were instructed to fix the end of the third link to an arbitrary position, forming a four-bar linkage.
We then simulated the un-forced motion of the linkage.
